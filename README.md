Sure, here's a README file for your University Document Retrieval System using RAG and Streamlit:

# University Document Retrieval System using RAG

## Objective
Enhance student access to university documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Project Description
This project implements a RAG-based ChatBot system to facilitate the retrieval of information from university documents. The system integrates various university documents and webpages stored as embeddings, and processes them into chunks of 500 tokens using LangChain. It leverages the top-5 chunks to query a language model with a curated system prompt, ensuring precise and context-aware responses. The application is hosted on Streamlit.

## Features
- **Document Integration:** Load and process multiple documents for information retrieval.
- **Chunking:** Split documents into manageable chunks for better processing.
- **Embeddings:** Use OpenAI embeddings to convert document chunks into vector representations.
- **Retrieval:** Retrieve top-5 relevant chunks based on user query.
- **Language Model:** Use OpenAI's language model to generate context-aware responses.
- **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly interface for asking questions and displaying answers.

## Project Structure
- **app.py:** Main application script to run the Streamlit app.
- **requirements.txt:** File listing all the dependencies required for the project.

## Files Description
### 1. app.py
This Python script includes:
- Loading and processing documents from the local directory.
- Splitting text into chunks and embedding them using OpenAI embeddings.
- Creating a RetrievalQA chain to handle user queries.
- Running a Streamlit app to allow user interaction and display answers.

### 2. requirements.txt
This file lists all the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- LangChain
- FAISS
- OpenAI API

You can install the required Python packages using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project
1. Place all your university documents (PDF or text files) in the same folder as this script.
2. Save the implementation code in a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
3. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server and open the app in your default web browser. The app allows users to ask questions about the university documents, retrieves the top-5 relevant chunks, and provides precise and context-aware responses using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach.
